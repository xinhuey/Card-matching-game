# Known bugs & Workarounds
1. The cards do not rearrange themselves correctly when the window is resized 
    Workaround: Would have to implement dynamic checking of the canvas size and adjust coordinates accordingly
2. The animations for flipping/shuffling/winning do not work
    Workaround: Would need to implement the animations in displayList.ts
